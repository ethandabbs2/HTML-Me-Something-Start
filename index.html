      <h1>My name is Ethan Dabbs and here is a little bit about myself!</h1>
      <p>
         I'm 23 years old and I'm looking to start my programing career through launchcode. Although  
         this is the goal I've been working towards for the past couple years
         now, most of my life was spent trying to be a pro ice hockey player!
         Being from St. Louis, I played for many different teams around the area 
         as I grew up. Starting at kirkwood youth hockey, up through the St. louis AAA Blues 
         and the St. Louis Junior Blues. This was all before leaving home to continue playing 
         junior hockey in Wisconsin and eventually college at Missouri State University.

      <p>
         Playing hockey for me was really the only thing I could see myself doing when I was 
         growing up. Hockey was absolutely number one on my mind and that led me to the decision 
         to take a gap year after highschool. My first year after highschool I lived in 
         Milwalkee, Wisconsin and played hockey for the Milwalkee Power. The time I spend there 
         was a rollercoaster to say the least, there were bright spots like the host family I 
         lived with, but just about everything else was a mess. Being able to be on my own and adapt 
         to a new city was an expirence that I'll forever be greatful for.

      <p class="funParagraph"> 
         After the chase for pro hockey was over, I had to look for something else that I could work at 
         the same way. Software development and coding was always something that was around me growing up 
         as my father is a developer himself with 45+ years of expirence. Being around him my whole life 
         and seeing everything hes been able to do is incredibly inspiring and is one of the biggest factors 
         supporting me in my persuit to reach that level. Obviously, coding isn't easy and it's even harder
         to stick with but I think sometimes through the learning proccess theres so much information I try to 
         retain and it gets a little overwhelming. I just think it's important to go back and play with what
         you already know, and use it, because you know more than you think sometimes. Its important to 
         remember why you wanted this in the first place! Use what you've learned!
